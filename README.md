# OpenTelemetry QA Assignment - COMPLETE SOLUTION

## 🚀 Quick Start (2 minutes)

```bash
npm install
node app.js
```

**In another terminal:**
```bash
node run-all-tests.js
```

## 📋 Complete Validation Checklist

### ✅ Task 1: Basic Verification
- [x] App starts and shows "OpenTelemetry initialized successfully"
- [x] `/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}` with trace_id
- [x] `/orders` returns orders with trace_id
- [x] `/orders?fail=true` returns 500 error with trace_id

### ✅ Task 2: Trace Validation
- [x] trace_id present (32 hex characters)
- [x] span_id present and unique
- [x] service.name visible in logs
- [x] status.code correct (0=success, 2=error)

### ✅ Task 3: Metrics Validation
- [x] Node.js runtime metrics (eventloop_lag, memory)
- [x] HTTP metrics (request count, duration)
- [x] Prometheus endpoint: `http://localhost:9090/metrics`

### ✅ Task 4: Log Correlation
- [x] Same trace_id in response and server logs
- [x] Same span_id in response and server logs
- [x] Error correlation working

### ✅ Task 5: Failure Simulation
- [x] App continues when exporters fail
- [x] Graceful degradation tested
- [x] High load resilience validated
- [x] Recovery capability confirmed

### ✅ Task 6: QA Summary Report
- [x] Comprehensive documentation: `FINAL_QA_REPORT.md`
- [x] Professional test results
- [x] Improvement recommendations
